# Numericat
Numerical solution of the Schrödinger equation for arbitrary potentials and visualisation of the results.

This project will consist of three parts:
* Parsing of an arbitrary one dimensional potential function (C)
* Numerically solving the time dependent Schrödinger equation by using the Crank-Nicolson method (C)
* Visualising the results (Java)
